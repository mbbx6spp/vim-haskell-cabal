Haskell Cabal Plugin
====================

WARNING: This is a fork of the original syntax-only cabal vim plugin. This fork will include `:Cabal`
commands to automate the running of Cabal commands within vim and opening the errors and output using 
vim's builtin buffer types to make integration as seamless as possible.

If @Twinside (who originally wrote the Cabal syntax file) wishes to incorporate my changes into his repository
he/she may. I just want to be clear that this is not just going to be a syntax file so it may change the way
your existing vim setup works more than just syntax highlighting of .cabal files. Be warned.
